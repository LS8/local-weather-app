# Local Weather App

This is my solution to one of the 'Intermediate Front End Development Projects' at FreeCodeCamp

You can click here to visit the projects page https://schoettker.github.io/local-weather-app/

When a vendor changes his policy it might affect one of these project, if you notice a broken/bugged project please let me know (or submit a PR if you want :P)
